# syncArt (sync.art)

The music market is primarily composed of streaming services and social media, which not only disconnect artists from their audience but also rob creators of their rightful share of revenue, channeling it towards strictly business-oriented purposes that may not necessarily align with artistic goals. Currently, without streaming services, musicians are unable to publish their music, and without social media, they cannot communicate with their audience. For an artist to make their work public, they must navigate through numerous stages, from verification to payments, which becomes burdensome and requires unnecessary additional work. Today, being an artist is primarily a business activity, emphasizing professional management rather than achievements in the field of art. This is because the model for conducting such streaming/social media activities for artists has taken the form of B2B2C, where the second 'B' refers to the artist. Consequently, one can expect that as the functionality of a given service increases, the complexity of procedures between 'social media/streaming service' and 'artist' will also increase. The multitude of various platforms and fragmented management has contributed to an enormous market entry threshold. Social media has become a jack-of-all-trades machine – encompassing everything from cooking recipes to computer games and local dress sales. For the listener, an artist's profile is presented right after a politician's performance, with whom the artist wants nothing to do. Shortly afterward, they receive a message from a coworker about a business trip to Morocco. Social media has deprived artists of quality and left no alternatives, blending them in with the pursuit of the best cake recipes. It has merged them with every other aspect of life, leaving no opportunity to stand out from the mundane. And it is precisely because of this that this document was created, aiming to restore quality to the artist, providing them with new tools and a means to share what matters most to them – art.

To restore the role of artists on the internet, a new business model is needed, where the center belongs not to monopolistic services but to the artist. Although the model of operations may appear the same – B2B2C – the first "B" will belong to the artist, who will decide with whom and under what conditions they will collaborate. If they choose, they can limit themselves to B2C, which is sufficient for sharing their compositions and communicating with the audience. The second "B" in B2B2C represents the front-end layer of the application for client/application-visual communication <-> database, which can be developed for various activities.

To achieve this, one must understand the shift toward a new field in web applications, namely blockchain technology. Since all data stored on blockchain networks are decentralized, meaning data distribution does not rely on a single provider, building an appropriate model for a blockchain network allows us to bypass the need for centralized communication entities. Utilizing information about the artist's identifier (i.e., their wallet address), we can send them a message. The message can convey our intention to purchase their album, and we can directly send them payment for the album. Then we can send them a photo from their latest concert, and as a token of gratitude, the artist can send us a ticket for their next concert for free, along with a personalized message and image, serving as a reminder of that great day. All of this can happen without the involvement of third parties, and the only requirement for operation is the front-end application (which can be hosted on a decentralized hosting platform like IPFS) that simplifies the use of the network.

Every blockchain network creator should provide such a basic application version because otherwise, it is difficult to speak of a functional utilization of such a network due to the complex interface for direct communication with the blockchain network. Another advantage of this approach, for example, is the possibility of maintaining direct contact between the artist and fans attending concerts. The artist can filter out individuals who provided their identifier upon entry to the concert and allow them to purchase a live recording of that concert. The artist can identify the top 10% most active people on their "wall" and offer them a discount on their products. For festival-goers, the artist can provide NFTs that grant access to the concert of another affiliated artist. The entire power of shaping the business model returns to the hands of the artist, who can not only think about their next composition but also explore infinite possibilities for engaging with and exchanging data with each individual audience member.

The key role in the new approach to serving the artist's role on the internet is the selection/creation of a blockchain network and contracts operating on the blockchain network. These models define specific data requirements for communication and allow for scalability. This is the starting point because without functioning logic and network scalability, the application is not viable. Another aspect is an application that enables communication with the blockchain. It should provide all possible network functionalities in a user-friendly graphical interface. Additionally, a mobile application is necessary to scan identifiers at artistic events. Another consideration is the use of AI, which will aid in data analysis, support the artist in decision-making, and provide inspiration for their work.
